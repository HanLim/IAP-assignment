				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>HL's App Store is a website that provide various type of apps for Android users. Unlike the Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store which allow their users to have an account for free and they can make a choice whether to pay for the application which cost them money or download some free application, users who wish to download apps from this Apps store are required to have register for a premium account and they will be given unlimited access to download from the website. The users are can also have a month of free trial before they register for a premium account. Besides that, the website will choose an application from the store and let all the Android users, with or without an account to download for free.</p>
				<h1>Survey and Research</h1>
				<p>Taking the two biggest mobile application store in the market, Play Store and App Store as reference, HL’s Apps Store let the users to view and download the application from the website. However, one of the major difference between these stores with HL’s App store is the users are required to have a premium account (or maybe trial account) in order to download the applications. Besides, the link for download and activation key will be sent to the emails of the account owner and the users have to enter their credential every time they want to download application from the store. The website has a minimum amount of words as most of the user would not like to read a long paragraph comparing to viewing images and videos with interactions.</p>
				<h1>Design and Development</h1>
				<p>As mentioned above, videos and images are all over the website and they are able to show meaning to the user without using too much of words. The website is mobile responsive, however it requires the user to view it in landscape mode. This is due to the website is in a single page without needing the user to scroll, and all the contents in the page are presented in multiple slides. Whenever the webpage detects the resize of the screen, it will resize to the optimal size and resolution to provide the maximum user experience to all its user. The template of the website, which includes the header, navigation bar, sidebar and the footer are being created as independent pages and are loaded into the page using jQuery to prevent redundancy of codes while animations of the site are mostly done with the aid of JavaScript and CSS. Due to the usage of jQuery load() function to load the template of the website and loading XML into the website, loading the website in a Local Server is needed if the website is viewed in Google Chrome unless the user start chrome with “—allow-file-access-from-file” option. Viewing the website using Mozilla Firefox without Local Server can be done without any problem.</p>

				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
